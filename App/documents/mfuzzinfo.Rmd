## Mfuzz clustering
---
Mfuzz is a Clustering tool for  RNAseq data using fuzzy c-means clustering.  </br>
It performs soft clustering of genes based on their expression values using the fuzzy c-means algorithm. </br>
By uploading a csv file of gene expression per time points, you can obtain this kind of plots :

### <u> Choosing the number of clusters </u> </br>
To help choosing the number of clusters, there are two methods, the <b> inertia </b> and the <b> elbow </b> methods. </br> 

- <b> Inertia Method </b></br>
The inertia method consists on choosing the number of clusters corresponding to the point where the inertia drop gets minimal. </br>

- <b> Elbow Method </b></br>
The elbow method consists on plotting the Within Sum of Squared (WSS) along the number of clusters. The <i> right </i> number of clusters corresponds to the point where the line forms a elbow. </br>

- <b> Checking overlap </b></br>
If the number of clusters is too big, some clusters can overlap. </br>
This can be checked in the overlap PCA. </br> 

### <u> Mfuzz Plots </u> </br>

The plots are showing automatically and a download button is available where files of clusters with membership values will be saved on your computer's desktop. </br>
You will obtain as many file as the number of clusters you have. 
We recommend to previously create a specific folder and modify line 154 of server-mfuzz.r file to include the folder.
